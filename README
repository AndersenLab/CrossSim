CrossSim  
-Joshua Shapiro

A system for simulating genetic crosses. 

The functionality is pretty basic, but it supports haploid or diploid individuals, tracking an arbitrary number of chromosomes. 

Recombination is modeled without interference, and all coordinates are on the genetic map. 

TODO:
Add ability to convert genetic map to physical.
Add possibility of mutations during the cross.
